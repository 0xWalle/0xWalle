ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @0xWalle, A core developer of ORC Protocol with over 5 years of blockchain development experience.

ORC Protocol was created with my good friend HarrisonðŸ‘€. Since the birth of Ordinals, we've seen a lot of new energy in Bitcoin, but also a lot of shortcomings. 

We want to get involved, build some infrastructure that are needed by users, and attract more developers to build a new open protocol for Bitcoin, so we created the âœ¨ORC Protocolâœ¨.

> ðŸª§Notes: 
> 
> This is my newly created github account, I want it to be isolated from my work, for now it's interest that drives us to build ORC Protocol, in the future we may be involved full-time.
